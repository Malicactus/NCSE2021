YES,Advancing Urban Heat Resilience,50-Minute Concurrent Session,Heat,Climate & Covid - The Combined Impacts of Multiple Stressors (I),"Thursday, January 7,",12:00-12:30p.m. ET,Ladd,Keith,Ph.D.,ladd@email.arizona.edu,Assistant Professor in Planning and Sustainable Built Environments,University of Arizona,"In the summer of 2020, extreme heat collided with the COVID-19 pandemic, amplifying existing public health risks, particularly for marginalized communities. Urban heat is deadlier than nearly all other U.S. weather-related hazards combined, with risks increasing due to climate change and the urban heat island effect. Urban heat also has implications more broadly for communities including public health, quality of life, urban ecology, water and energy usage, infrastructure, and the economy. Research continues to advance understanding of the characteristics of resilient cities and their governance, but translating this knowledge about urban resilience into practice remains a challenge. Decades of urban climate scholarship have documented the impacts of urban heat, but it remains a climate risk without a mature governance structure for the 14,000 municipalities in the U.S. While communities enhance their resilience to risks such as hurricanes, wildfires, and earthquakes with local land use controls, state and federal legal precedence, mapping resources, and national guidance, no comparable urban heat resources exist. An assessment of over 3,500 climate adaptation resources in the U.S. found that only 4 percent specifically focused on heat. Despite these challenges, communities are pursuing a variety of strategies to mitigate urban heat in the built environment and increase their resilience. This session will present the current state and innovations in urban planning, design, and governance for urban heat resilience. The panelists will discuss the concept of urban heat resilience, the latest from a U.S. survey of urban planners and review of U.S. municipal plans. Attendees will gain insight into challenges and opportunities in research and practice to advance urban heat resilience.",,

In the wake of COVID-19, SMEs are greatly impacted by safety measures limiting customer interactions, employee availability, as well as larger supply chain issues. Early predictions estimate 15,000 retail store closures and 3 million jobs lost (Bivens, 2020; Thomas, 2020) with minority businesses disproportionately affected (Fairlie, 2020), but these numbers are quickly evolving. As COVID-19 conditions persist, the chances are high that populations around the country will experience heat waves, floods, hurricanes, fire, and drought during the period of virus transmission and into the period of recovery (Philips 2020). SMEs in areas vulnerable to natural hazards and disasters are particularly noteworthy in the context of COVID-19 for two reasons. First, their paths to recovery not only include public health concerns, but also adaptation and mitigation planning to help them brace for impending climate events. Second, effects from COVID-19 stand to exacerbate the lingering effects of past natural hazards and make recovery increasingly difficult. This session will highlight coordinated research being conducted across NIST and NOAA’s Regional Integrated Science and Assessment (RISA) Program that explores the complexity of Climate Resilience for SMEs in the COVID-19 context. It will highlight the importance of prolonged and longitudinal social science research that takes into account regional and social differences. Presenters will discuss specific research projects that focus on complex, concurrent, and cascading climate and health risks, and will identify challenges, innovations, and opportunities for adaptation and recovery.",,

National, regional, and local scale climate information is necessary to support effective decision-making by farmers, livestock producers, resource managers, and other agricultural stakeholders. The same data and information are important for the scientific community to track change as it plays out across the landscape of American working lands and to work with decision makers to devise appropriate and effective response measures. A consistent ongoing information framework can help agricultural decision-makers and scientists to identify the types, magnitude, and impacts of changing temperature, water and other important climate indicators now being faced by agricultural producers and land managers across the U.S.     The session discussion will center on results from a recently completed scientific assessment project supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that responds to the need for accurate information that can be consistently tracked over time. Climate Change Indicators for Agriculture, released as a USDA technical report in July 2020, identifies twenty different data products that can be used as indicators that show how climate change is affecting agricultural systems. Speakers will describe indicators that show how the climate context is changing for U.S. agriculture, how this change is affecting seasonal timing, pests, and weeds, how crops and animals are responding, and how change is affecting the economic and human costs of extreme conditions.",,

It provides water to 40 million people and 5.5 million acres of irrigated agriculture in the U.S. with the served area having an economic value of $1.4 trillion annually. It has been a river of conflict and over the last couple of decades compromise. The Colorado River runs through seven basin states (Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona, California) and is shared through the agreements made in the 1922 Colorado River Compact. It is also the subject of a treaty between the U.S. and Mexico. The Colorado river basin has been experiencing a severe and crippling drought for the last twenty years, which has put a strain on river supplies and the agreements sharing those waters. Members of the U.S., Mexico, the seven basin states, Native American tribes and non-governmental organizations stepped up to the challenge and navigated the changing climate with new agreements and a record setting pulse-flow experiment where the River met the ocean at the Sea of Cortez. The drought continues to be a challenge and all parties are finding new and innovative ways to address it. This panel will address the effects of climate change presently and in the future; summarize existing compromises to sustain the River; and address innovative drought planning within the basin.",,

As scientists work tirelessly to formulate an effective response to the virus, they have also been called on to engage policymakers and the public with the information they need to effectively manage public health and restore the functioning of our economies and societies. These scientific voices are working to cut through the noise in a media environment that has been saturated with information - and misinformation - about the pandemic.    What does existing research and evidence-based practice teach us about how to effectively share science with decision makers and the public in a time of crisis? What have we learned from the pandemic about how to communicate with lay audiences about complex scientific topics?    This panel presents lessons from efforts to communicate with the public about research and expertise related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Panelists will share their experiences communicating science ranging from essential public health information like effective mask use to social science research that provides context about how issues like inequality, economic crisis, and environmental stressors intersect with the pandemic. They will explore what the COVID-19 pandemic can teach us about science communication, particularly the importance of being responsive to the needs of different audiences.",,

During the summer of 2020 Native American communities in the Southwest, Great Basin, and Northern Great Plains, are also experiencing extreme heat and severe drought which is further straining COVID-19 response and recovery.     Heat, combined with little snowpack, a lack of monsoonal rains, and high winds, have stressed the native lands in the American West and forced communities still grappling with COVID impacts to develop new approaches to food sovereignty and community health. Starting in mid-March 2020, members of the Native Waters on Arid Lands (NWAL) project team initiated weekly Zoom calls with tribal members, federal agency program leaders, and tribal extension agents and faculty to identify COVID-19 impacts and to develop actions to address urgent issues and strengthen agriculture and food sovereignty for reservation communities.     Speakers in this session will illustrate how compounding environmental factors such as heat and water stress have complicated COVID response. They will also describe innovative approaches taken by Native Americans and Indigenous communities around the world to build resilience to COVID and other extremes, including those pioneered by the Working Group on Indigenous and Earth Sciences Knowledges and Practices in response to COVI-19. Through the lens of Two-Eyed Seeing, place-based solutions to complex global challenges can be achieved. The Two-Eyed Seeing Approach is rooted in the concept that knowledge from multiple sources founded in native wisdom and western science, when weaved together, allow the “seer” to gain a more complete understanding of our role in the environment.",,

In the wake of COVID-19, academic and industry researchers are teaming up to help detect, monitor, track, and eliminate the spread of the virus. Collaboration among these groups is essential in order to beat the virus. However, as we experience the current pandemic and think back to past natural disasters, we ask ourselves whether decision makers are equipped, through access to science, to address these challenges. The panel will explore topics including: what have we learned about national and state-level responses to COVID-19? Do decision makers have readily available access to the science they need? Are there any scientific barriers to preparing ourselves for future disasters/events? Is there anything the State or researchers could do better to help improve the collaboration? Is the collaboration working? What opportunities does the disruption caused by COVID-19 present for increased resilience in natural resource, energy, medicine, workforce, technology, and economic contexts? How do demographic and socioeconomic factors influence how people are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and similar outbreaks?",,

And community colleges will likely play a key role in helping prepare those workers for jobs as economies restart.        While community colleges, in the aggregate, are the largest, most flexible and most reliable “engine” of training in the country, at the ground level for each college the road has never been smooth.    Of the nearly 1,200 public community colleges, service and advising is often uneven. There are time lags between sensing job market shifts and gearing up with the right courses and programs. And there are built-in organizational conflicts that can make it hard to quickly build new programs. But some colleges are working to overcome those challenges to respond to the pandemic .”    This session is going to share how community colleges in Florida, Hawaii and Texas have modified their instruction methods and created wraparound services to support their students.         The Dallas College has created a Chief Critical Response Officer in charge of evaluating the data and making assertive decisions to keep our students, employees and community safe. A comprehensive community and academic services are now offered that include tablets with hotspots, for those students with no access to Internet.        Seminole State College of Florida is helping Central Florida hospitals deal with the COVID-19 pandemic by loaning essential supplies to local hospitals. The College’s Respiratory Care program loaned 10 ventilators from the respiratory care lab at the Altamonte Springs Campus to Orlando Health. Seminole State’s Allied Health, Nursing, and Public Safety departments sent 800 masks to AdventHealth’s Emergency Medical Services (EMS) team.

Each panelist brings a particular perspective and expertise to the topic. I have been an invited moderator for interdisciplinary environmental panels at my home institution and across the U.S. I cultivated a relationship between Allegheny College and Dr. Robert Glennon in 2018 -- he was the inaugural recipient of the Allegheny College Ewalt Environmental Scholar Award. When I read Carl Hiaasen’s article in the Ledger in December 2019, I decided to launch a project to visually document (in real-time, using web cams and water level gages) the persistent inundation in portions of Key Largo, FL. While the global pandemic has prevented me from launching this project, I’d like to bring together the key people who have helped shaped this idea and will argue that this is a critical moment to link personal stories with real-time video access to climate change impacts in the United States.         Confirmed speakers:    Dr. Robert Glennon (https://robertglennon.net/) is the Morris K. Udall Professor of Law and Public Policy at the University of Arizona.

YES,"Irrigation Modernization: How to keep the water flowing for food, farms and fish",50-Minute Concurrent Session,Water,"Governance in a Changing World: Food, Energy and Water (H)","Wednesday, January 6,",12:00-12:30p.m. ET,Margi,Hoffman,,margi.hoffmann@fcasolutions.org,Strategic Operations Director,Farmers Conservation Alliance,"Aging agricultural infrastructure, an expanding population, persistent droughts, food scarcity, lack of access to clean water for our most vulnerable populations and declining fish populations are stressing scarce water resources. Farmers rely on irrigation systems to grow food. But the dams and canals that capture and convey this water from rivers to farms were often constructed over 100 years ago and do not utilize the best in available technology to make them more efficient.         By addressing fundamental problems in aging water infrastructure, irrigation modernization provides unifying, multi-benefit solutions for rural farming, the communities they serve and the environment. Water saved from seepage below and evaporation above is then able to support both farms and wildlife conservation, while the gravity-pressured water eliminates the need for farmers to maintain costly pumps. In addition, the modernized system allows for the inclusion of hydroelectric power generation, providing both a resilient, local energy resource for the community and an earned revenue stream for the district. Modern irrigation systems support large, international farms, as well as local farms ensuring access to quality food for all parts of the community, especially vulnerable, underserved, impoverished populations. Lastly, modernizing irrigation districts offers an opportunity to co-locate broadband, fiber optic, or buried transmission lines, expanding access to the internet for rural communities and reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfires. These multi-benefit projects:        • Reduce operations and maintenance costs;    • Increase water reliability;    • Develop local renewable energy resources and increase energy efficiency;    • Strengthen the resilience of local communities; and     • Improve fish and wildlife habitat.",,

In a post-COVID world, postsecondary education institutions, with their campus grounds and public service missions, are well- situated to teach the integrated social and ecological sciences that will allow students to relocalize food production and better manage nearby watersheds and climate mitigation strategies to protect wildlife. We propose that the experiential methods of the “living laboratory” offer unique advantages to research, teach and support these regenerative social-ecological systems needed in post-COVID-19 North America. Living Labs integrate research, teaching and community engagement through interdisciplinary, placed-based experiential learning and action in the built and natural environments. Our session will highlight the last two years of “living lab” work by our three universities in partnership with non-profit organizations, businesses, First Nations and tribal governments around the Lake Superior watershed. Thanks to a generous partnership grant from the Canadian government, we have been sharing our community-based research and teaching experiences with the living lab model in order to create a network of “living labs” dedicated to justice oriented social-ecological research and teaching in our region. Our presentations will underscore integrated science/social science methods involved in designing, building and assessing (on and off campus) living lab sites focused on regenerative agriculture, eco-entrepreneurship, community trust-owned solar energy, community kitchens, local seed banks, food forests and wildfood foraging and local commons and indigenous paradigms for managing watershed, forest and climate ecosystems.",,

Because of this, communities across the country are seeking the information and tools necessary to accurately assess future hazard exposure and understand their vulnerabilities. Hazard mitigation efforts at the local level provide an opportunity to incorporate information on future risks into existing mitigation program requirements. Communities and states that are interested in undertaking forward-looking planning efforts are challenged by several factors, including: (1) resources for assessing future climate risks are distributed across organizations; (2) projections of hazard risk depend on future emissions pathways as well as Earth system variability; and 3) as a result of 1 and 2, there is a lack of clear information, tools and methodologies that could be readily used by hazard mitigation planning practitioners. As a result, the inclusion of future hazard projections due to expected environmental change is not a common practice.  Community or organization-scale application of the science of future hazard projections within existing planning frameworks is not a trivial task. Even with increasing availability of scientific tools and data on future environmental conditions, applying climate change-induced impacts in natural hazard preparation remains a technically challenging and resource intensive activity for community officials. This session will explore ways that Federal agencies are co-developing resources to move research into practice to reduce U.S. communities’ future hazard risk and highlight examples of how information and guidance produced by Federal agencies are applied to specific local action.",,

These networks ensure that a variety of communities have sustained and localized access to the scientific expertise, data, and support they need to adapt and become resilient in the wake of extreme change. While each network meets the mission and stakeholder needs of that particular agency, regional scale climate shifts and weather events have widespread and complex impacts. The sharing of knowledge and leveraging of resources across agencies is imperative for addressing the extensive ramifications of climate change. This panel will discuss how the NOAA Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments (RISA) program, the USDA Climate Hubs, and the DOI Climate Adaptation Science Centers (CASC) coordinate and collaborate at the federal level.

In 2020, LightWorks at Arizona State University and the Security and Sustainability Forum hosted a four webinar series on How “Smart Systems” Can Power Our Decarbonized Future. The series convened officials from ASU, IBM, Microsoft, Novartis, Siemens, John Deere, Land O’ Lakes and the Farmers’ Food Network to address the potential for industry to use artificial intelligence to reduce GHG emissions while improving productivity, maintaining, or increasing profitability and identifying the technological, business, policy, and social challenges in its application in a decarbonized future. The series opened with a framing webinar based on design thinking followed by deeper dives into AI and decarbonization in manufacturing, cities, and the food system. The series also addressed the concern about how artificial intelligence can be trusted to reflect human values, where social vulnerabilities might occur, and the skills that will be needed to perform new jobs AI will create in the future.

Singapore has adopted the holistic water supply and management approach towards self water-reliance within its limited natural freshwater resource. Singapore’s integrated water management strategy encompassing policy and urban planning since the early years has continued to evolve and remain relevant for its social-economic development. Strategic implementation and decisions from policy makers together with new knowledge and novel solutions from practitioners and scientists are keys pillars to sustaining the holistic approach. Singapore’s water journey from a 721 km2 city-state populated with 5.7 million people together with experiences from others could be iterated and adapted for a bigger quest to quench the world’s thirst. This continuous journey is faced with escalating challenges. Impacts of climate change have worsened the precarious balance of water supply and demand that threatens livelihoods and security. This increases the pressure which has already been felt over the past decades due to the increasing population growth, urbanization and industrialization. Consolidated efforts of inter-disciplinary expertise are required in solving this ever changing water scarcity issue. Of late, big data analytics and machine learning have also carved into many different aspects of water management and supply.

The number of undergraduate and graduate degree programs, research institutes, and centers focused on sustainability has markedly increased in the past five years. However, there is currently a rich debate around defining key competencies for interdisciplinary sustainability programs. Several high-profile institutions have studied this issue, including the National Council for Science and the Environment’s Alliance of Sustainability and Environmental Academic Leaders and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and have noted that the lack of core competencies for sustainability remains a key limitation to fully characterizing the effectiveness of sustainability education. Evidence-based core competencies for interdisciplinary sustainability programs can provide suitable guidance for curriculum and program development, research, policy, communication, and pedagogical approaches at academic institutions. The growing demand for well qualified sustainability professionals within the public, private, and nonprofit sectors also points to the value of developing core competencies.     In response to this critical need in sustainability education, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine will release a consensus study report in early Fall 2020 with recommendations to strengthen sustainability programs and curricula in higher education. In addition to sharing the study findings, this session will include an interactive discussion among the speakers and participants to discuss the feasibility of implementing the proposed recommendations, share other suggested strategies to strengthen sustainability education on their own campuses, and the role of academic institutions for advancing sustainability in the context of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.",,

In the past decade, storytelling has become a buzzword in science engagement, and for good reason: compared to evidence-based argumentation, narratives are more engaging, more comprehendible, more believable, and more persuasive. Storytelling centers the experiences and reactions of human beings, and underscores that a single real event can hold many simultaneous truths.     The idea of many simultaneous truths is a key element in the world of facilitation and mediation as well. If you have fifteen people in a room trying to sort out an issue, one might have 15 different “truths” based on their lived experience, backgrounds and knowledge. How do we bridge such differences when we are juggling a rapidly changing world of flood, drought, heat, and more.     This session ties together practical skills from both storytelling and mediation to address critical questions at the intersection of science, policy, and implementation.     The presenters include Liz Neeley, Executive Director of the Story Collider, and Lara Fowler, faculty at Penn State and a professional water mediator.

Catastrophic wildfires can significantly threaten lives, infrastructure, and critical ecosystem services. The severity of catastrophic wildfires is predicted to worsen with climate change and an expanding wildland urban interface, creating an urgent need to leverage science and technology to mitigate increasing wildfire risk while fostering healthy, natural environments.    The 2018 California wildfire season was the most destructive and deadliest on record, raising a number of complex policy issues for the state. As the state considers a balanced response to this increasing threat, there is a growing need for a broad network of stakeholders, researchers, decision makers, and philanthropists to work together to mitigate, prepare for, and respond to catastrophic wildfires.     How do we ensure that actions are taken and money is spent in the right areas? Should resources be focused more on response or mitigation efforts?

This is certainly true for campus- and community-oriented sustainability programming, where engagement through a “shared sense of place"" is particularly difficult in a virtual or blended context. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the transition to virtual programming in Spring 2020 created challenges for sustainability practitioners across campus. At the Office of Sustainability, Earth Week programming quickly had to be adapted for online delivery. Undergraduate student interns at the Office of Sustainability, serving as consultants for departments and organizations across campus, had to be trained in a virtual space. And at the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies, instructors of an introductory sustainability course suddenly had to engage students with their campus and its systems via digital lectures and laboratory activities. Stories like these are not unique to our institution and have transpired on college and university campuses around the globe.    In this session, sustainability practitioners from the University of Wisconsin-Madison will share their experiences responding to the coronavirus pandemic. Presentations will be informed by overarching questions such as, ""What does a student- and community-facing sustainability program look like during a pandemic?"" and, ""In a virtual or blended space, how do you engage students in meaningful ways around campus- and community-based sustainability?” Presentations also will consider how a pandemic might create opportunities to make sustainability issues more salient for people.

For example, in the 1820s, New York City was a global leader in linking upstate water sources to NYC; Chicago pioneered industrial-scale food processing in the nineteenth century; and Phoenix boomed in the twentieth century thanks to massive government investments in hydroelectric and water management projects. Building on this record, entrepreneurs and city leaders across the nation in the twentieth century massively expanded urban access to clean water, cheap electricity, and abundant food resources. Yet, the interferences across these FEW systems is not well understood and is not easily managed. Furthermore, while there are research and development-oriented venues in which some agencies partake, there is no systematic channel for sharing new knowledge and innovations with urban planners and communities. American cities are currently facing critical challenges in the efficient use, conservation, reuse, and recycling of resources. City, state, and federal leaders have had difficulty monitoring or pricing resource use accurately.     This session will bring practitioners, stakeholders, urban planners, and researchers to share best practices, experiences, and research results in system-based solutions for sustainable and resilient cities. This session will include lighting talks on but are not limited to: innovative energy management, resource reuse and recovery in the waste stream, food production, such as vertical farms and distribution in urban environments, and other innovative solutions in FEW nexus approach.",,

However, government actions, messaging, and population behaviors intended to reduce risk for a severe storm event are associated with increased social interactions and the congregation of populations in sheltering and healthcare venue spaces.     This panel discusses: 1) How planners might adjust current planning practices to reduce harm while at the same time protecting population health, and 2) Current knowledge gaps and critical research questions that must be addressed in order to mitigate risk and protect population health during a compound pandemic-hurricane event.    Understanding the dynamics of sheltering and evacuation behavior and the intersections with planning and emergency management is directly tied to virus spread and the health and wellbeing of populations. How we may effectuate meaningful evacuation and sheltering of medically fragile and vulnerable populations under the compound pandemic-hurricane threat is of practical consequence.    Storm surge and flooding inundation stemming from hurricane events do not impact all communities and population equally. Some populations are more vulnerable relative to others. For example, although being at greater risk stemming from a storm’s impact, individuals with impairments, such as physical, cognitive, and sensory deficits, as well as truncated social and financial networks, may have a lower propensity to evacuate. Elderly populations, especially those that reside in underserved communities that lack the means and ability to appropriately prepare for, and recover from, the shifting environment, are vulnerable to both immediate- and long-term impacts of severe storm events. These populations disproportionately may shelter in place and utilize sheltering venues.",,
YES,Adaptive governance of rivers: all about the capacity to reallocate water?,Five-Minute Flash Talk Presentation,Social and Ecological Sciences,"Governance in a Changing World: Food, Energy and Water (H)","Wednesday, January 6,",1:00-2:30p.m. ET,Peter M.,Rudberg,Ph.D,peter.rudberg@geoviable.org,Researcher,GeoViable,"Allocation of water for societally beneficial uses, including hydropower and irrigation agriculture, has expanded at great speed during the last century. At present, many river basins are highly modified and show clear signs of overallocation of water, causing substantially reduced fluvial connectivity which deteriorates riverine ecosystem integrity and resilience. Water stress is projected to increase with climate change that reduces precipitation and increases evapotranspiration. This creates significant sustainability and governance challenges in multiple river basins across the globe. Adaptive governance is a prominent research field directed towards such governance challenges. Research to date has mainly focused on structural components - such as degree of polycentricity – and cognitive and relational processes – including learning, collaboration and actor network changes – to analyze and understand adaptive governance and propose modifications to approach such desirable governance of natural resources. These research efforts do not always provide clear insight into the problem-solving capacity of adaptive governance structures. In highly modified river basins, I therefore propose that the research field would advance by focusing on the capacity to reallocate water, both between societally beneficial uses and to increase fluvial connectivity. Actual reallocations of water in a country and river basin, faced with sustainability challenges, would thereby serve as an indication of the extent of adaptive governance of the system. This could in turn represent a starting point for empirical investigation which I argue would benefit by drawing on insight from the established field of water reallocation research. I use examples of water reallocation from hydropower production to increase fluvial connectivity in the USA and Sweden, EU’s top hydropower producer, as the empirical basis to illustrate the value of my proposed approach.",,

The adverse consequences of these narrow sectoral policies on social and ecological systems are likely to be exacerbated by the anticipated impacts of climate change, urbanization, population growth, increased consumption, and other drivers of change. In response to these shortfalls, recent years have seen increasing emphasis on the nexus approach to managing food, energy and water (FEW) resources as complex inter-dependent systems. The nexus approach calls for the equal and simultaneous consideration of FEW systems and their reciprocal relationships as a means of enhancing synergies and reducing trade-offs. Moving toward the nexus approach requires a rethinking of the assumptions, goals, knowledge systems and institutional mechanisms that informed past resource management approaches. However, the social and institutional requirements for pursuing the nexus approach have not received enough attention. Importantly, the mechanisms by which a transition toward the nexus approach can be initiated are poorly understood. To address these knowledge gaps, this paper draws from the literature on adaptive water governance. Adaptive water governance relies on flexible multi-level institutions to facilitate interactions among individuals and organizations across multiple scales in an adaptive ecosystem-based approach to managing land and water resources. Adaptive water governance is a promising institutional mechanism for promoting good governance and the sustainability of complex FEW resource systems, as well as building the capacity of FEW systems to adapt to drivers of change across scales.",,

As all their outreach and public programming was onsite, the Arboretum was forced suspended activities for visitors and members. In order to continue to fulfill their education mission, neighboring Penn State Brandywine faculty and students partnered with the Arboretum to offer virtual podcast discussions every two weeks, from April through July 2020. Similar to a book club and based off the Podcast Brunch Club model, Penn State faculty and students prepared thematic podcast listening lists consisting of six-to-eight podcasts individuals listened to ahead of time. The listening list topics were focused on nature themes such as water, world biomes, and Sustainable Gastronomy Day. Members of both the Arboretum and the Penn State communities pre-registered to join the biweekly discussions after listening to the podcasts and viewing the list of discussion questions posted on the project website. Several participants returned week after week because “I enjoyed the last discussion” and “I find these discussions interesting and informative.” Interestingly, a question on the registration form revealed that members of this campus-community group previously were not active podcast listeners. By the fifth time the group connected, several participants started asking what they as individuals could do to help with the environmental challenges that were coming up in the podcasts and discussions. For the ninth and final discussion, the organizers shared pathways for advocacy and engagement to benefit Earth’s systems. The biweekly sessions ended as the Arboretum was able to open to visitors and the University was preparing for the start of the fall semester. These two organizations view the online program as a new and effective model for engagement during a time challenged with physical distancing restrictions.",,

Human activity – especially through that of modernity - has disrupted Earth’s water cycle to the point of severely endangering potable water availability and security to millions of people worldwide and to innumerable species across the globe. Simultaneously, this disruption also has created a serious loss of biodiversity, some of which promotes water availability. Issues of deforestation, over-grazing, industrialized agriculture, urbanization, and human population swells are among the culprits undermining Earth’s water – the planets natural cooling system. As a result, we not only have seen serious losses of fresh water across continents along with the loss of biodiversity, but also, we are experiencing the continual warming of the planet which not only further stresses water availability, but threatens our own species’ continued existence.     While “green” technology solutions have occupied the center of discourse in addressing the multiple ecological crises facing humankind, little-to-no discussion has focused on nature-based solutions – especially in capturing fresh water. The intent of this panel is to offer insights into nature-based solutions as a means of addressing ecological problems – in this case revitalizing fresh water availability – and to initiate discussion as to the centrality of nature-based solutions in addressing water and its relationship to the climate crisis.",,

The session is aimed at addressing reducing disaster risk and increasing resilience to natural hazards in different development sectors by utilising new technologies and enhancing stakeholder engagement. DR3 involves complex processes with different stakeholders at all administrative levels. Two elements in particular play a major role: the need to ensure stakeholders' interoperability through an efficient exchange of data, and the inclusion of socioeconomic factors which may influence DR3 processes. Our discussion will have interdisciplinarity across different data communities and services, exploring how to re-energize the role of different institutions for more resilient communities. We will discuss initiatives, practices in integrating data technologies (such as artificial intelligence data-driven algorithms, machine learning and predictive technology), tools and methodologies, as well as traditional and non-traditional sources of data, and how partnerships could help in the measurement and monitoring of disasters risk reduction. We will debate efforts to coordinate and integrate disparate organisational and technical elements; share best practices and foster new data literacy; real-time maps; highlighting vulnerable areas and communities by incorporating different indicators from multiple sources. Combining data from different sources can help relief organizations to provide early warnings and verify reports in real-time.

Cities in India are witnessing a shocking decline in the health of their wetlands. Polluted lakes and disappearing freshwater bodies are visible effects of unsustainable growth in urban areas. While some motivated citizens work earnestly to expose illegal activities, organize clean-up drives, and monitor biodiversity, the magnitude of the challenge continues to increase. How can we actively engage all urban residents, especially the next generation, in the efforts to save and restore wetlands and to ensure sustainable development?    Stories offer a powerful medium to think about issues deeply, understand limits on our capabilities, and imagine scenarios that are likely to happen. Stories also help us reflect about concepts with details that are necessary to build the plot, the conflict, and the resolution.     We provide a story creation canvas to reflect on how the environment shapes our lives and how our actions shape the environment.   COEXIST or Creating Original Earthy eXciting STories is a project that helps students  - create stories on local wetland phenomena  - internalize the seriousness of the state of urban wetlands  - design actionable pathways for change  - share the message among peers    COEXIST stories typically follow the hero’s journey template, thus creating a feeling of empowerment—any character can be a hero and can make a difference.

It has amplified challenges of the ecocrisis, particularly those related to inter and intra- generational equity and the long-term viability of the biosphere to support life as we know it. Despite the fact that urgent changes are needed to advance sustainability progress, how to catalyze systemic transformations remains contentious and unclear. Alternative pathways towards collective wellbeing are a promising, yet poorly understood approach to solving complex socioecological problems. This research explores this research gap by examining how mindfulness and contemplative practices can help contribute to sustainability transformations during times of crisis. Practices such as mindfulness have been found to increase awareness while also enhancing capacities for empathy and compassion. These qualities are essential not only in the pursuit of individual wellness but also collective lasting wellbeing. Furthermore, mindfulness has been shown to increase connection to the natural world as well as commitment to its protection. By nurturing notions such as interdependence and interbeing, mindfulness practices can also support a deeper understanding of and appreciation for complex systems, which are essential for navigating the numerous challenges of the current global crisis. As we wake up to the unfolding new reality of the COVID-19 pandemic, cognitions enhanced through mindfulness nurturing will become increasingly important for cooling the waters of a planet under pressure.",,

In addition to the more than 10 million active cases worldwide and more than half a million people killed, there are degrading economic implications, like projected declines in commerce and trade, as well as social implications, including mental health issues, rising unemployment, and even the exacerbation of systemic racism. There are also direct implications for national security institutions, like the U.S. military, intelligence, and other national security organizations, that have curtailed operations to prevent the spread of the virus. The national security implications also extend how COVID-19 affects whether human beings can satisfy their basic needs, often viewed as an amplifier of social tension, unrest, and even political instability in key national security documents. COVID-19’s interconnected impacts represent how complex human security issues have national security implications. However, the preparation and response to COVID-19 seems to reflect that contemporary national security perspectives at various institutional levels do not yet prioritize the evaluation of issues like COVID-19 and other complex issues that, in reality, shape national security. Based in part on the insights gleaned from a mixed methods thesis study of how biases and heuristics about climate change could affect the conduct of intelligence activities, this presentation aims to communicate how the COVID-19 crisis serves as a case study for not only how national security is affected by complex issues, but also how national security is affected by the injection of scientific and social complexity itself.

As sustainability scientists and educators cope with a new era of how to translate teaching and learning into real-world impact, cultivating key competencies remains an essential objective. However, in an era defined by the transition to online, remote, and virtual learning, the fundamental tenets of sustainability science and education have been undermined. This presentation will explore strategies for educators to enhance their practices for developing and assessing key competencies for sustainability in learners within the context of digital learning. Participants will come to understand how to identify leverage points for engaging digital teaching and learning, adapt content to address the complexity and uncertainty of current issues, and activate students’ sustainability competencies to address these issues. The presentation will synthesize insights collected from a set of sustainability education experts, supplemented by a systematic literature review to establish principles for digital learning to support sustainability practice. Despite the ongoing evolution of challenges not only to social-ecological systems, but also to the educational mechanisms utilized to generate young professionals who can contribute to sustainability problem-solving, pathways to impactful teaching and learning remain.

Despite the acceleration of climate change, architecture is increasingly designed as hermetically sealed boxes, requiring increased conditioning, which in turn further contributes to the greenhouse gas emissions warming up our planet. In addition to disassociating people from the natural environment, this also creates spaces where people disconnect from their community, and live within boxes both physically and socially. Currently, existing research exploring nature-human relationships in new construction lacks definition in architectural design, and there is a gap in the understanding of the social impacts of sustainable strategies. In this thesis, I established key terminology for ‘program externalization’, which defines the types of indoor-outdoor relationships through a series of criteria, and evaluated the social impacts of such an approach in different qualities of space. Thorough literature review and case study analyses allow for improved understanding of the role of externalization within architectural design, and lead to the development of the learned lessons, key program types, and design strategies that can enable implementation of externalization. This process will highlight the environmental and social benefits, and make a case for why building program externalization is crucial for architectural design in the context of climate change and growing concerns for social connectivity.",,

This effort is strengthened by participation of leaders from Midwestern higher education institutions (students, faculty and administration), local governments, and the private sector in both content development and audience participation. The Summit values Midwest voices and leaders; a focus on the Midwest context - adaptation, mitigation, resilience in the Midwest - highlighting linkages to national and international climate issues; diversity of speakers and the communities they represent; content that is responsive to the reality of COVID, racial injustice - how can recovery be equitable and sustainable; and climate hope - we can make a difference. Think Tank workshops will be specifically organized around four tracks: Research; Teaching and Education; Climate Action; and Outreach and Engagement. While the tracks have topically specific objectives, all aim to engage attendees in questions of: midwest climate impacts; equity and justice around climate action; new knowledge development needs; accessibility of existing knowledge; identification and documentation of best practices and equitable recovery. This concurrent session will share outcomes of the workshops focusing on solutions, models, further collaborations and best practices that our partners aim to move forward through the Summit Session and ongoing post-summit collaborations. The Think Tank and Summit process and outcomes can also serve as a model for other regional multi-sectoral collaborations to advance local climate action.",,

It will briefly discuss the over 50 years of research surrounding human exposure to nitrate in drinking water and detail key findings from epidemiological studies on human health effects as well as recent invitro work conducted by the author and colleagues currently under publication.  The current maximum contaminant level (allowable limit), MCL under the Safe Drinking Water Act, SDWA for nitrate, 10 ppm nitrate-nitrogen, is written only to protect infants from acute health effects of nitrate involving hemoglobin oxygen binding disruption on the erythrocyte (RBC), known as methemoglobinemia. The difference between the acute and chronic health effects will be explained as well as a brief, visual overview of the epidemiology, indicating that chronic health conditions and their relationship to nitrate exposure in drinking water should be carefully considered when MCLs are reviewed and reevaluated under future SDWA reviews.   The chronic disease epidemiological studies of nitrate impacts from drinking water exposure date back to the mid-1970s and into the present. A wide variety of health conditions have been examined. These conditions encompass cancers, birth defects, diabetes, and genetic damage, among others. What could help explain the possible biological mechanisms of these effects? This flash talk will also detail some of the possible biological mechanisms associated with nitrate’s ability to encourage proinflammatory processes in the body and contribute to genetic stress. This will be supported by reference to past research and the presenters’ current research work focusing on proinflammatory cytokine expression as studied invitro with controlled exposure to nitrite (the bioactive form of absorbed nitrate).",,

YES,Source tracking metabolically-active bacteria from rainwater to produce,Five-Minute Flash Talk Presentation,Water,Improving Water Quality (F),"Wednesday, January 6,",1:00-2:30p.m. ET,Leena,Malayil,Ph.D.,lmalayil@umd.edu,Postdoctoral Associate,University of Maryland,"Rooftop harvested rainwater (RHRW) is gaining increasing interest as a potential irrigation water source. Previous studies have indicated the presence of both biotic and abiotic factors affecting RHRW quality. However, very few studies have investigated the potential transfer of microbes, particularly metabolically-active bacteria, from rainwater to irrigated soil and produce. To bridge this knowledge gap, we tracked and characterized metabolically-active bacteria from irrigation water (ambient rain, first flush tanks, secondary tanks and municipal water) to irrigated soil and produce using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (a DNA label) coupled with next-generation sequencing techniques. A total of 364 samples (irrigation water=64, soil=160 and produce=140) were  collected from a vegetable raingarden in Maryland, U.S.A from June to August in both 2018 and 2019. Subsamples were treated with BrdU. DNA from all samples was extracted and PCR-amplified for the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500. The sequencing data were analyzed using QIIME, multiple R packages and SourceTracker. Irrespective of sample type, BrdU-treated samples were characterized by statistically significantly lower alpha diversity. Bacterial profiles observed in BrdU-treated samples, irrespective of sample, were Pseudomonas spp., Sphingomonas spp., Aeromonas spp., Arthrobacter spp., Sediminibacterium spp., Bacillus spp., and Curvibacter lanceolatus. Using the SourceTracker tool we were able to track and quantify the relative contributions of the irrigation water to the bacterial community of the irrigated produce. Our preliminary findings 1) suggest that the presence of metabolically-active bacterial pathogens from irrigation sources is important, as contamination events can occur through the use of RHRW to irrigate food crops; and 2) can be applied to develop appropriate on farm RHRW treatment technologies prior to irrigation.",,

These often contentious, multi-stakeholder policy settings serve as an ideal case in which boundary spanning actors are thought to promote cooperation across diverging interest groups, policy learning, and collaborative outcomes. This research integrates boundary spanning and discourse theories to investigate the use of policy narratives in a collaborative governance approach to manage agricultural nonpoint source water pollution in California. California’s Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program takes a unique collaborative governance approach by creating water quality coalitions that operate as boundary organizations, structurally situated between the centralized state water agency and farmers, and tasked with building cooperation among farmers and motivating the implementation of improved nutrient management strategies. We present participant observation and interview data with coalition representatives, farmers and state regulators to characterize the narrative strategies and approaches the coalitions employ under different settings to work toward the desired policy outcomes. Our findings suggest that this coalition-based decentralized policy structure amplifies contextual and ideological differences in actors across geographies, leading to varying levels of success in reaching policy goals and protecting water quality. We discuss trade-offs of collaborative policy structures that may allow for more locally-adaptable policy implementation, but also leave policy outcomes vulnerable to regional differences and varying approaches to managing and enforcing environmental regulations.",,

Extreme heat is the deadliest of all weather-related disasters in the U.S. (Hondula et al. 2015). Vulnerable communities are particularly at risk for extreme heat-related health impacts (Kovats & Hajat, 2008), making it a social justice issue as well. Extreme heat has also been linked to declines in economic productivity (Watts et al., 2018), can raise energy and water usage (Guhathakurta & Gober, 2007), causes additional stress to urban ecosystems (Merckx et al., 2018), and threatens the viability of cities (Pal & Eltahir, 2016).    Despite this, the understanding of viable strategies to address extreme heat is still limited. An assessment of over 3,500 climate adaptation resources in the U.S. found that only 4 percent focused specifically on heat (Nordgren, Stults, & Meerow, 2016). Mahlkow & Top-down planning and design strategies for extreme heat are often not given priority over other community values, such as aesthetics (Hatuka & Saaroni, 2014).    We have developed an interactive web-based visualization tool which teaches users about possible extreme heat interventions in a fun, game-like environment, and have used this tool in a version of a deliberative poll. A deliberative poll is a form of what public participation scholar Caroline Lee has termed “New Public Participation” (NPP; Lee et al. 2015). NPP practices incorporate rigorous public participation in novel ways and spaces, beyond traditional electoral politics.    Our research demonstrates that this process helps educate the public about extreme heat and allows for better understanding of the tradeoffs associated with extreme heat resilience interventions. Furthermore, this process ensures that even difficult climate-related political decisions can be accepted within communities through an improved participatory process.",,

The drought involves an increase in extreme temperatures and heatwaves, as well as its intensity and extension. Such changes have impacted the industrial activities co-located in the central region, intensifying the competition by water resources and catchment. The high temperatures have increased evapotranspiration, reducing water retention in soils, reservoirs, and distribution systems. Further, the precipitation rates have decayed, affecting the snow accumulated at the Andeans Mountains, essential for the water supply in the warmer season. Finally, the volume into rivers has declined, increasing the gaps between water supply and water demand. Given the increase in water requirements, water withdrawals have affected the recharge of aquifers, causing negative impacts on the water circle. At the policy level, discussions have begun to encourage the reuse of water, opening the debate at the level of regulatory implications.  This talk aims to analyze the interrelation between technical concerns with entanglements at the regulatory level for one specific new source of water: the reuse of wastewater. Our interests are related to the technological options and effects on greywater treatment and reuse activity within the Chilean regulation (Grey Waters Law). For this purpose, we will focus on water treatment conditions as an alternative for resources of a different quality from that required for sanitary use, such as irrigation, industry, mining, among others. We will examine the Grey Water Law proposed and its possible interactions with other national regulatory bodies, such as the Water Code, the water quality standards, and the Sanitary Services Law. Similar experiences about the general characteristics of the systems implemented in other countries such as Israel, Spain, and the United States (California) will be exposed as a reference to evaluate the Chilean regulation",,

Increasing temperatures on the ground, rising sea levels, threatened ecosystems, greater storm intensity, extreme drought, unprecedented wildfires, and increasing risk of spreading infectious diseases are just some of the manifestations already being felt. This presentation cuts across all five focus areas of the 2021 NCSE conference, but perhaps best fits under ""Systems and Solutions"" because ultimately, an effective climate strategy touches on all of these areas.    The challenge ahead is daunting. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has reported that time is quickly running out. Left unchecked, climate change could push the global mean temperature anomaly past the Paris Agreement lower threshold of 1.5-degrees Celsius as early as 2030. Like Covid-19, the trajectory of climate change is exponential, a fact which makes the pace of change difficult to grasp. And like Covid-19, concerted human intervention is needed right now to begin “levelling the curve” in order to avert the worst consequences.    We have no choice but to buckle up for a bumpy ride, as we buckle down on strategies that can work at the scale needed –not just to reduce emissions, but to restore the earth’s energy balance. This fast-paced presentation will explain what’s driving climate change, what we need to accomplish before 2030 to begin to stabilize the climate, what we need to do to get there, and a current international effort underway to support this action.",,

The problems that this project solves are the lack of E85 supply for FFV owners and the overpopulation of hyacinths. Due to hyacinths high lignocelluloses content they can be considered a promising substrate for the production of bioethanol. The research innovation proposed consist of the study of endemic tropical bacteria population from three different, non food waste biomass and their way to development of a third generation’s fermentation process the future conversion into ethanol. It could be useful as a source of biomass because of its abundance and feasible cultivation. The impact of this innovation could have over society will consists of improving the quality of life and the environment while providing an alternative fuel that is less pollutant at a lower cost than fossil fuels.

The location of an Early Care and Education (ECE) facility impacts children’s potential exposures to environmental contaminants; for example, an ECE facility housed within a formerly polluted industrial building can increase exposure to harmful chemicals. This issue is even more prevalent for Black children, children of color and low-income children who are more likely to live in contaminated ecosystems due to inequitable factors such as housing discrimination. To address this issue, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) funds 28 state health departments to evaluate past and present exposures to environmental hazards and to prevent future exposures through ATSDR’s Partnership to Promote Local Efforts to Reduce Environmental Exposure (APPLETREE). Through the APPLETREE program and ATSDR’s Choose Safe Places for Early Care and Education (CSPECE) program, states are given resources and guidance to assess and respond to site-specific issues involving exposure to hazardous substances in the environment by identifying exposure pathways, reviewing environmental and health data for potential health risks, making recommendations for prevention, and educating affected communities and local health professionals. ATSDR’s CSPECE is implemented in collaboration with CEHN, ELI, and NACCHO. This poster presentation will highlight activities, resources, and success stories that resulted from the 2017 - 2020 funding cycle.

According to data, the Western Highlands of Guatemala are one of the primary origins of UACs at the border, with an average age of 15 years old. There are many drivers causing this out migration, including: citizen security, food insecurity, climate change, lack of economic opportunity, among others. While these interconnected issues are complex, interventions engaging youth from these regions are required to spur skill-based employment opportunities. Guatemala’s National Central School of Agriculture (ENCA) and Virginia Tech are collaborating to explore opportunities to integrate renewable energy with agriculture systems to foster experiential learning opportunities for students across the ENCA network of 19 schools throughout the country which offer vocational education to 14-18 year olds. Of particular interest to collaborators, are applications utilizing solar photovoltaics integrated with value-added crops via “agrophotvoltaic” (APV) systems. While these project opportunities are in the early exploration phase, system concepts show promising opportunities for applications on school campus and beyond, particularly in the country’s “corredor seco” (dry corridor) where variable drought cause food insecurity issues. In these regions, future applications may afford: microclimates for semi-shade tolerant high-value crops; infrastructure for rain water harvesting for storage and efficient irrigation; renewable energy generation for on-site use (e.g., water pumping, rural electrification) and grid interconnection, energy storage hubs, among other potential benefits.

Extreme weather patterns and disaster events caused by global climate change increases the risk of flooding events. Flooding creates excessive indoor moisture which allows for increased mold (fungal) growth that can cause respiratory health problems for occupants. Exposure to these microorganisms often occurs though resuspension of dust from carpet. The advent of DNA-based measurement methods for microbes reduce the biases inherent in previous culture-based methods but can be greatly impacted by sample collection methods. We aim to characterize the collection efficiencies of two different carpet dust collection methods to better estimate microbial exposures. We spiked dust with known concentrations of bacterial cells of Bacillus atrophaeus and fungal spores of Aspergillus fumigatus and embedded it into nylon carpet of varying pile heights. The dust and spiked microorganisms were then vacuumed from the carpet utilizing two different attachment methods. One attachment utilized a cellulose thimble filter positioned inside the vacuum hose which collects the dust directly inside the filter. The collection efficiency using the thimble filter ranged from 56% to 95% dust recovered for medium pile carpet and low pile carpets, respectively. The other vacuum adapter has a nozzle positioned on the end of the hose with an enclosed petri dish where the dust collects on a flat filter paper. The dust collection efficiency for the flat filter apparatus ranged from 54% to 70% recovery for medium pile carpet and low pile carpets, respectively. For both methods, medium pile carpet retained more dust compared to low pile carpet. Incorporating collection efficiencies is important to avoid underestimation of microbial exposure, which has important implications for those with allergies and asthma.",,

The reaction of formation of these molecular inclusion complexes is addressed in this research, as well as the main types of complexes that could be obtained. The Multiples Minima Hypersurface methodology, quantum chemistry calculations based on the Density Functional Theory and a topological study of the electron density were employed in order to characterize the interaction space of the two pollutants with the symmetrical conformers of the three CDs. Finally, for the β-HCH@CDs complexes a study of the charge distribution, charge transfer and dual descriptor was employed to elucidate the forces involved in the formation of these nanoaggregates. The formation of nanoaggregates was also experimentally addressed. Three types of fundamental interactions were observed: total occlusion, partial occlusion and external interaction (non-occlusion). The more stable complexes were obtained when the γ-CD is the host molecule, as it was confirmed experimentally by means of results of spectroscopic and electron microscopy analysis.

The carbon emissions and other impacts from thousands of miles of transportation can be eliminated, along with other stresses due to elaborate industrial support systems. The inequities which were caused by shifting production to areas with weaker labor laws and environmental regulations can be resolved. Local communities can be empowered by retaining investment and employment opportunities. Revitalizing local economies can improve their quality of life and raise their standard of living. Having a direct connection between producers and consumers strengthens environmental protection and conservation of resources. Entrenched interests and long-standing practices create daunting obstacles, but relocalization can be achieved due to the significant economic advantages. The urgent need for carbon reductions and sustainable use of resources will drive this trend forward.",,
YES,"Teaching in the zone: Water, land use, and the Earth’s critical zone",Poster Presentation,Water,Innovative Practices for Sustainability Education (E),"Tuesday, January 5,",1:00-2:30p.m. ET,Katherine,O'Neill,Ph.D.,oneill@roanoke.edu,Associate Professor of Environmental Science,Roanoke College,"Human well-being depends upon the health of land and water. Ecosystem services including clean drinking water, food production, and nutrient cycling all depend upon complex interactions between water, soil, the atmosphere, and living organisms that occur at the Earth’s surface. The ‘critical zone’ (CZ) refers to the thin layer of the Earth’s surface, from the tops of the vegetation to the depths at which groundwater freely circulates, that is critical for the health and wellbeing of nearly all terrestrial life – including humanity. This socio-ecological framework for examining the Earth’s surface integrates a number of key concepts in Environmental Science (ES). Yet, surprisingly little CZ science has filtered to the undergraduate level, particularly at primarily undergraduate institutions, where concepts from the earth sciences, if taught at all, are often framed with little direct conceptual overlap with other natural and social sciences. Since 2014, Roanoke College, an undergraduate liberal arts institution in Salem, VA, has partnered with the NSF-funded Calhoun Critical Zone Observatory to develop an undergraduate course in Critical Zone Science and Management and has restructured its Environmental Studies program to include a curricular track in “conservation and the critical zone”. This poster discusses insights from using critical zone science as an integrating theme in an undergraduate Environmental Studies program, with specific focus on the teaching of interactions between land management and water dynamics.",,
YES,The COVID19 & Climate Change Syndemic: Recognize Global Threats & Opportunities,Poster Presentation,COVID-19 in Context,Climate & Covid - The Combined Impacts of Multiple Stressors (I),"Wednesday, January 6,",1:00-2:30p.m. ET,Holly,Rosencranz,MD,harosen@illinois.edu,Clinical associate professor of medicine,University of Illinois College of Medicine,"Introduction: Climate change presents unprecedented health threats. It is imperative that medical trainees understand the implications of climate change/planetary health on the physical and mental health and well-being of their patients. Recently, the COVID19 pandemic has presented additional threats to personal and planetary health, with numerous overlaps in risk and vulnerabilities. Students are provided with information regarding the pathophysiology and treatment of COVID 19, but not necessarily the connection between climate change and this pandemic. Climate change and the COVID19 pandemic have created a syndemic that must be addressed through shared solutions. We created a workshop for medical students to consider the shared drivers, vulnerabilities and opportunities for solutions to climate change and COVID 19. Methods: We will address second-year medical students on 7/24/2020. We prepared a didactic of health impacts of climate change and aligned these impacts with those of COVID19. Students will be assigned to one of four threats; heat, air pollution, environmental degradation and extreme weather. They will consider scenarios in which patients can present with illness due to both climate change and COVID19. They will propose therapies and strategies at the individual level as well as mitigation and adaptation for the community. Students will be surveyed regarding their knowledge and ability to address this syndemic before and after the session Results: (pending) We predict that students will demonstrate a significant recognition of the shared impacts and threat multipliers presented by COVID19 and climate change. Discussion: Our workshop will give students an increased recognition of the shared drivers and solutions for both climate change and COVID19 that impact their patients’ health and care. Additionally we strive to encourage them to consider their patients’ public health locally and globally and foster climate responsiveness and pandemic preparedness.",,
YES,Can Recycling Education Programs Promote Recycling Rates in the U.S.?,Poster Presentation,Social and Ecological Sciences,Innovative Practices for Sustainability Education (E),"Tuesday, January 5,",1:00-2:30p.m. ET,Younsung,Kim,PhD,ykih@gmu.edu,Associate Professor,George Mason University,"The U.S. recycling rate has dramatically improved from 6.4% in 1960 to 35.1% in 2017. However, it has been stagnant around 34 percent for the past decade. Also, according to the OECD survey, the US has been placed in the 25th in its recycling rate, lagging behind most European countries and a few Asian countries like South Korea and Taiwan. Prior research has pointed out public participation and insufficient information about best recycling practices as part of the reasons for the stagnant recycling rate. However, there is little research about recycling program education in the US in general, as well as the role of public education on the recycling rate in particular. Filling the research gap, this study analyzes the role of recycling education programs on recycling rates by relying on the US EPA’s database on Environmental Education Grants. The US EPA has funded a total of 3,751 environmental education grants and a cumulative total of $75 million dollars has been spent during the period of 1992 to 2017. This study finds that recycling education programs have been underfunded across the nation as compared to other environmental literacy programs and face big leaps/gaps across states. The study will shed light on the imminent need for public and private investments for recycling education programs, which will then promote recycling and contribute to the creation of the circular economy.",,
YES,Watershed conservation for water provision in rural chilean patagonia,Poster Presentation,Social and Ecological Sciences,Addressing Water Scarcity (A),"Tuesday, January 5,",1:00-2:30p.m. ET,Alejandro,León,Ph.D.,aleon@renare.uchile.cl,Associate Professor,Universidad de Chile,"Freshwater provision is key for the sustainability of life in rural communities in remote areas in the Los Ríos region, in the northern section of the Chilean Patagonia. The area has experienced a 20% decrease in annual precipitation during the last century, and an expected additional 15 to 30% by 2100 (RCP 8.5 scenario). Thus, conservation of the watersheds providing freshwater is paramount. This is an on-going project aimed at estimating the seasonal variations of the waterflow in three micro watersheds in Raulintal, a private property of 2.058 currently oriented to the conservation of the natural forest dominated by Nothofagus alpina and Nothofagus dombeyi. The catchments provide freshwater for the 300-families rural communities located downstream, Mashue and Llancacura, devoted to subsistence farming. We performed statistical analysis on the precipitation and flow data (1997-2016) recorded at 8 nearby stations. Through streamflow transposition we estimated the mean monthly flow at the exit point of each basin, obtained seasonal curves and estimated its contribution to the potable water systems in the neighbouring communities.  Preliminary results show a maximum water harvest during June and July with 5.0 m3/s; and a stable baseflow of 1.5 m3/s during the other months. The supply in June could satisfy a 15% of the demand by the nearby communities. In recent years the local counties have invested significant funds to provide water transported by trucks, in an area where water is abundant, but there is a lack of investment in infrastructure for storage and distribution. Conservation throughout microcatchments is relevant to guarantee the provision of fresh water throughout the year, but especially during the dry season. Likewise, in view of the climate change scenarios, it will be necessary to adopt an integrated management approach of water resources, which also considers adequate storage and distribution infrastructure, highly needed by the studied communities.",,
