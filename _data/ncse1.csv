In addition to the more than 10 million active cases worldwide and more than half a million people killed, there are degrading economic implications, like projected declines in commerce and trade, as well as social implications, including mental health issues, rising unemployment, and even the exacerbation of systemic racism. There are also direct implications for national security institutions, like the U.S. military, intelligence, and other national security organizations, that have curtailed operations to prevent the spread of the virus. The national security implications also extend how COVID-19 affects whether human beings can satisfy their basic needs, often viewed as an amplifier of social tension, unrest, and even political instability in key national security documents. COVID-19’s interconnected impacts represent how complex human security issues have national security implications. However, the preparation and response to COVID-19 seems to reflect that contemporary national security perspectives at various institutional levels do not yet prioritize the evaluation of issues like COVID-19 and other complex issues that, in reality, shape national security. Based in part on the insights gleaned from a mixed methods thesis study of how biases and heuristics about climate change could affect the conduct of intelligence activities, this presentation aims to communicate how the COVID-19 crisis serves as a case study for not only how national security is affected by complex issues, but also how national security is affected by the injection of scientific and social complexity itself.

It’s time to buckle down on strategies that can work at the scale needed –not just to reduce emissions, but to restore the earth’s energy balance. Find out what we need to accomplish before 2030, and why, in order to begin stabilizing our climate.",,,,,"<br />Until now, the concept of “Drawdown” has focused primarily on the reduction or removal of emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide.  This work remains essential. However, given what we now know about the full range of factors contributing to the earth’s energy imbalance, and hence climate change, this presentation explains why it is time to reframe the concept of “Drawdown” to be more expansive.  <br /><br /> <br /><br />In addition to GHGs, which have a positive “radiative forcing” effect (thus warming the planet), we need to focus on other contributors to positive radiative forcing, including short-lived climate pollutants as well as from non-emission factors such as changes in albedo, and even changes in negative climate forcers.  We also need to ensure that all Drawdown solutions are evaluated on a level playing field for their potential inadvertent adverse impacts. Finally, we must take a hard look at how rapidly we must drawdown radiative forcing in the near-term – by 2030 and 2040 – in order to bridge the gap until longer-term CO2-based strategies can begin being effective in 2050 and beyond.  <br /><br /> <br /><br />The IPCC has warned that climate change could push the global mean temperature anomaly past the Paris Agreement lower threshold of 1.5-degrees Celsius as early as 2030. By expanding the scope of Drawdown, we can determine what we need to accomplish during this critical next decade and beyond, and what we need to do to get there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The problems that this project solves are the lack of E85 supply for FFV owners and the overpopulation of hyacinths. Due to hyacinths high lignocelluloses content they can be considered a promising substrate for the production of bioethanol. The research innovation proposed consist of the study of endemic tropical bacteria population from three different, non food waste biomass and their way to development of a third generation’s fermentation process the future conversion into ethanol. It could be useful as a source of biomass because of its abundance and feasible cultivation. The impact of this innovation could have over society will consists of improving the quality of life and the environment while providing an alternative fuel that is less pollutant at a lower cost than fossil fuels. BBF’s and R&D component will be developing a new anaerobic fermentation process for the conversion of biomass in ethanol, biogas and byproducts. Experimental trials showed a good percent of glucose per mg/L of biomass. A special strand of acetogen bacteria in addition to a simple pre-treatment process effectively breaks lignocelluloses/lignin recalcitrance. Funding are running by and NSF/DOE SBIR proposal.

YES,Adaptive governance of rivers: all about the capacity to reallocate water?,Five-Minute Flash Talk Presentation,Social and Ecological Sciences,(H),"Governance in a Changing World: Food, Energy and Water (H)","Wednesday, January 6,",1:00-2:30p.m. ET,Peter M.,Rudberg,Ph.D,peter.rudberg@geoviable.org,Researcher,GeoViable,Stakeholder cognitive and relational change is a weak indicator of environmental governance outcomes. Highly modified rivers require water reallocation to improve ecosystem integrity. The scope of water reallocation should thus be a suitable indicator of the extent of adaptive governance of rivers.,,,,,"Allocation of water for societally beneficial uses, including hydropower and irrigation agriculture, has expanded at great speed during the last century. At present, many river basins are highly modified and show clear signs of overallocation of water, causing substantially reduced fluvial connectivity which deteriorates riverine ecosystem integrity and resilience. Water stress is projected to increase with climate change that reduces precipitation and increases evapotranspiration. This creates significant sustainability and governance challenges in multiple river basins across the globe. Adaptive governance is a prominent research field directed towards such governance challenges. Research to date has mainly focused on structural components - such as degree of polycentricity – and cognitive and relational processes – including learning, collaboration and actor network changes – to analyze and understand adaptive governance and propose modifications to approach such desirable governance of natural resources. These research efforts do not always provide clear insight into the problem-solving capacity of adaptive governance structures. In highly modified river basins, I therefore propose that the research field would advance by focusing on the capacity to reallocate water, both between societally beneficial uses and to increase fluvial connectivity. Actual reallocations of water in a country and river basin, faced with sustainability challenges, would thereby serve as an indication of the extent of adaptive governance of the system. This could in turn represent a starting point for empirical investigation which I argue would benefit by drawing on insight from the established field of water reallocation research. I use examples of water reallocation from hydropower production to increase fluvial connectivity in the USA and Sweden, EU’s top hydropower producer, as the empirical basis to illustrate the value of my proposed approach.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YES & CONFIRMED DETAILS,Adaptive water governance and the food-energy-water nexus,Five-Minute Flash Talk Presentation,Water,(H),"Governance in a Changing World: Food, Energy and Water (H)","Wednesday, January 6,",1:00-2:30p.m. ET,Kofi,Akamani,Ph.D.,k.akamani@siu.edu,Associate Professor,Southern Illinois University,"Recent years have seen increasing emphasis on the food, energy and water (FEW) nexus. However, the human dimensions of the nexus approach have not received enough attention. This paper discusses adaptive water governance as a mechanism for managing wicked problems in FEW systems.",,,,,"Conventional approaches to managing land and water resources have often emphasized the pursuit of narrow sectoral goals to the neglect of the complex interactions various sectors across multiple scales. The adverse consequences of these narrow sectoral policies on social and ecological systems are likely to be exacerbated by the anticipated impacts of climate change, urbanization, population growth, increased consumption, and other drivers of change. In response to these shortfalls, recent years have seen increasing emphasis on the nexus approach to managing food, energy and water (FEW) resources as complex inter-dependent systems. The nexus approach calls for the equal and simultaneous consideration of FEW systems and their reciprocal relationships as a means of enhancing synergies and reducing trade-offs. Moving toward the nexus approach requires a rethinking of the assumptions, goals, knowledge systems and institutional mechanisms that informed past resource management approaches. However, the social and institutional requirements for pursuing the nexus approach have not received enough attention. Importantly, the mechanisms by which a transition toward the nexus approach can be initiated are poorly understood. To address these knowledge gaps, this paper draws from the literature on adaptive water governance. Adaptive water governance relies on flexible multi-level institutions to facilitate interactions among individuals and organizations across multiple scales in an adaptive ecosystem-based approach to managing land and water resources. Adaptive water governance is a promising institutional mechanism for promoting good governance and the sustainability of complex FEW resource systems, as well as building the capacity of FEW systems to adapt to drivers of change across scales.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study is to highlight advanced low flow forecasting and increasing demands of water quality monitoring techniques in order to manage competing water resource needs in a growing population and climate change uncertainties.,,,,,"<br />Improving river basin management is always crucial to sustain essential services of rivers with adequate quantities of high-quality water to the growing population and warming climate. During the drought period in the Potomac River basin, three-quarters of the water Washington, D.C., metropolitan area relies on proper optimization of low flow forecast and Cooperative Water Supply Operations on the Potomac (CO-OP). The water is released from the upstream reservoirs when forecasted flow in the river is not sufficient for water supply or environmental flow requirement. Regardless of concerted efforts by local governments and water utilities in reducing nutrient discharge and other pollutants from wastewater plants in the region, water quality issues remain challenging including harmful algae bloom and emerging contaminants of concern. This presentation will highlight the trends of water quality monitoring needs and application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in advancing hydrological and water quality prediction in the river basin. Integration of process-based model for performance evaluation of stormwater green infrastructure and application of analytical probabilistic model for forecasting nutrient runoff are discussed. The result shows that in the case of complex hydraulic systems with limited monitoring data, application of artificial intelligence and machine learning is helpful in forecasting low flow. The result shows that integration of hydrologic modelling and machine learning techniques to simulate the decision-making process improves river basin management.

Attendees will gain insight into challenges and opportunities in research and practice to advance urban heat resilience.",,,,,"In the summer of 2020, extreme heat collided with the COVID-19 pandemic, amplifying existing public health risks, particularly for marginalized communities. Urban heat is deadlier than nearly all other U.S. weather-related hazards combined, with risks increasing due to climate change and the urban heat island effect. Urban heat also has implications more broadly for communities including public health, quality of life, urban ecology, water and energy usage, infrastructure, and the economy. Research continues to advance understanding of the characteristics of resilient cities and their governance, but translating this knowledge about urban resilience into practice remains a challenge. Decades of urban climate scholarship have documented the impacts of urban heat, but it remains a climate risk without a mature governance structure for the 14,000 municipalities in the U.S. While communities enhance their resilience to risks such as hurricanes, wildfires, and earthquakes with local land use controls, state and federal legal precedence, mapping resources, and national guidance, no comparable urban heat resources exist. An assessment of over 3,500 climate adaptation resources in the U.S. found that only 4 percent specifically focused on heat. Despite these challenges, communities are pursuing a variety of strategies to mitigate urban heat in the built environment and increase their resilience. This session will present the current state and innovations in urban planning, design, and governance for urban heat resilience.

As all their outreach and public programming was onsite, the Arboretum was forced suspended activities for visitors and members. In order to continue to fulfill their education mission, neighboring Penn State Brandywine faculty and students partnered with the Arboretum to offer virtual podcast discussions every two weeks, from April through July 2020. Similar to a book club and based off the Podcast Brunch Club model, Penn State faculty and students prepared thematic podcast listening lists consisting of six-to-eight podcasts individuals listened to ahead of time. The listening list topics were focused on nature themes such as water, world biomes, and Sustainable Gastronomy Day. Members of both the Arboretum and the Penn State communities pre-registered to join the biweekly discussions after listening to the podcasts and viewing the list of discussion questions posted on the project website. Several participants returned week after week because “I enjoyed the last discussion” and “I find these discussions interesting and informative.” Interestingly, a question on the registration form revealed that members of this campus-community group previously were not active podcast listeners. By the fifth time the group connected, several participants started asking what they as individuals could do to help with the environmental challenges that were coming up in the podcasts and discussions. For the ninth and final discussion, the organizers shared pathways for advocacy and engagement to benefit Earth’s systems. The biweekly sessions ended as the Arboretum was able to open to visitors and the University was preparing for the start of the fall semester.

We will discuss the importance of longitudinal research that takes into account regional and social differences and the challenges of research in shifting conditions.,,,,,"Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make up 44% of U.S. economic activities and are the lifeline for many local economies, employing 59 million people in 2018 (SBA 2018, 2019). In the wake of COVID-19, SMEs are greatly impacted by safety measures limiting customer interactions, employee availability, as well as larger supply chain issues. Early predictions estimate 15,000 retail store closures and 3 million jobs lost (Bivens, 2020; Thomas, 2020) with minority businesses disproportionately affected (Fairlie, 2020), but these numbers are quickly evolving. As COVID-19 conditions persist, the chances are high that populations around the country will experience heat waves, floods, hurricanes, fire, and drought during the period of virus transmission and into the period of recovery (Philips 2020). SMEs in areas vulnerable to natural hazards and disasters are particularly noteworthy in the context of COVID-19 for two reasons. First, their paths to recovery not only include public health concerns, but also adaptation and mitigation planning to help them brace for impending climate events. Second, effects from COVID-19 stand to exacerbate the lingering effects of past natural hazards and make recovery increasingly difficult. This session will highlight coordinated research being conducted across NIST and NOAA’s Regional Integrated Science and Assessment (RISA) Program that explores the complexity of Climate Resilience for SMEs, and which has evolved to incorporate impacts of  COVID-19 .

A consistent ongoing information framework can help agricultural decision-makers and scientists to identify the types, magnitude, and impacts of changing temperature, water and other important climate indicators now being faced by agricultural producers and land managers across the U.S. <br /> <br /> The session discussion will center on results from a recently completed scientific assessment project supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that responds to the need for accurate information that can be consistently tracked over time. Climate Change Indicators for Agriculture, released as a USDA technical report in July 2020, identifies twenty different data products that can be used as indicators that show how climate change is affecting agricultural systems. Speakers will describe indicators that show how the climate context is changing for U.S. agriculture, how this change is affecting seasonal timing, pests, and weeds, how crops and animals are responding, and how change is affecting the economic and human costs of extreme conditions.",,,"Margaret Walsh, USDA Climate Program Office (confirmed)<br /> Speaker 1:A Lawrence Buja, University of Nevada, Reno (confirmed)<br /> Speaker 2: Art DeGaetano, Cornell University (invited)<br /> Speaker 3: Peter Backlund, Colorado State University (confirmed)<br />",Margaret,Walsh,Ph.D.,margaret.walsh@usda.gov,"Senior Ecologist, Office of Energy and Environmental Policy",USDA,Lawrence,Buja,Ph.D.,lawrence.buja@gmail.com,Director of Strategic Initiatives,"University of Nevada, Reno",Arthur,Degaetano,Ph.D.,atd2@cornell.edu,"Professor and Director, Northeast Regional Climate Center",Cornell University,Peter,Backlund,M.A.,peter.backlund@colostate.edu,"Associate Director, School of Global Environmental Sustainability",Colorado State University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The location of an Early Care and Education (ECE) facility impacts children’s potential exposures to environmental contaminants; for example, an ECE facility housed within a formerly polluted industrial building can increase exposure to harmful chemicals. This issue is even more prevalent for Black children, children of color and low-income children who are more likely to live in contaminated ecosystems due to inequitable factors such as housing discrimination. To address this issue, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) funds 28 state health departments to evaluate past and present exposures to environmental hazards and to prevent future exposures through ATSDR’s Partnership to Promote Local Efforts to Reduce Environmental Exposure (APPLETREE). Through the APPLETREE program and ATSDR’s Choose Safe Places for Early Care and Education (CSPECE) program, states are given resources and guidance to assess and respond to site-specific issues involving exposure to hazardous substances in the environment by identifying exposure pathways, reviewing environmental and health data for potential health risks, making recommendations for prevention, and educating affected communities and local health professionals.

It has amplified challenges of the ecocrisis,<br /> particularly those related to inter and intra- generational equity and the long-term viability of the biosphere to support life as we know it (IPBES, 2019; IPCC, 2018; WWF, 2018).<br />While urgent changes are needed to advance sustainability progress, how to catalyze systemic transformations remains unclear. Alternative pathways towards collective wellbeing are a promising, yet poorly understood approach to solving complex socioecological<br /> problems (Wamsler, 2018; Koger, 2013; Amel et al., 2009). This research explores<br /> how mindfulness and contemplative practices can contribute to sustainability transformations during times of crisis. Practices such as mindfulness have been found to increase awareness while also<br /> enhancing capacities for empathy and compassion (Kjønstad, 2020). Furthermore, mindfulness has been shown to increase connection to the natural world as well as commitment to its protection (Wang et al., 2019). These qualities are essential not only in the<br /> pursuit of individual wellness but also collective lasting wellbeing (Gibson, 2017). By nurturing notions such as interbeing, mindfulness practices can also support a deeper understanding of and appreciation for complex systems, which are essential for navigating<br /> the numerous challenges of the current global crisis (Rauschmayer, 2019). As we wake up to the unfolding new reality of this global health emergency, cognitions enhanced through mindfulness nurturing will become increasingly important for cooling the waters<br /> of a planet under pressure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human activity – especially through that of modernity - has disrupted Earth’s water cycle to the point of severely endangering potable water availability and security to millions of people worldwide and to innumerable species across the globe. Simultaneously, this disruption also has created a serious loss of biodiversity, some of which promotes water availability. Issues of deforestation, over-grazing, industrialized agriculture, urbanization, and human population swells are among the culprits undermining Earth’s water – the planets natural cooling system. As a result, we not only have seen serious losses of fresh water across continents along with the loss of biodiversity, but also, we are experiencing the continual warming of the planet which not only further stresses water availability, but threatens our own species’ continued existence. <br /> <br /> While “green” technology solutions have occupied the center of discourse in addressing the multiple ecological crises facing humankind, little-to-no discussion has focused on nature-based solutions – especially in capturing fresh water.

This creates spaces where people are disconnected from others, and live within boxes both physically and socially. How can externalization reimagine the architectural boundary to be more connective and dynamic?",,,,,"Buildings currently account for 39% of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions annually, worldwide. Despite the acceleration of climate change, architecture is increasingly designed as hermetically sealed boxes, requiring increased conditioning, which in turn further contributes to the greenhouse gas emissions warming up our planet. In addition to disassociating people from the natural environment, this also creates spaces where people disconnect from their community, and live within boxes both physically and socially. Currently, existing research exploring nature-human relationships in new construction lacks definition in architectural design, and there is a gap in the understanding of the social impacts of sustainable strategies. In this thesis, I established key terminology for ‘program externalization’, which defines the types of indoor-outdoor relationships through a series of criteria, and evaluated the social impacts of such an approach in different qualities of space. Thorough literature review and case study analyses allow for improved understanding of the role of externalization within architectural design, and lead to the development of the learned lessons, key program types, and design strategies that can enable implementation of externalization. This process will highlight the environmental and social benefits, and make a case for why building program externalization is crucial for architectural design in the context of climate change and growing concerns for social connectivity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extreme weather patterns and disaster events caused by global climate change increases the risk of flooding events. Flooding creates excessive indoor moisture which allows for increased mold (fungal) growth that can cause respiratory health problems for occupants. Exposure to these microorganisms often occurs though resuspension of dust from carpet. The advent of DNA-based measurement methods for microbes reduce the biases inherent in previous culture-based methods but can be greatly impacted by sample collection methods. We aim to characterize the collection efficiencies of two different carpet dust collection methods to better estimate microbial exposures. We spiked dust with known concentrations of bacterial cells of Bacillus atrophaeus and fungal spores of Aspergillus fumigatus and embedded it into nylon carpet of varying pile heights. The dust and spiked microorganisms were then vacuumed from the carpet utilizing two different attachment methods. One attachment utilized a cellulose thimble filter positioned inside the vacuum hose which collects the dust directly inside the filter. The collection efficiency using the thimble filter ranged from 56% to 95% dust recovered for medium pile carpet and low pile carpets, respectively. The other vacuum adapter has a nozzle positioned on the end of the hose with an enclosed petri dish where the dust collects on a flat filter paper. The dust collection efficiency for the flat filter apparatus ranged from 54% to 70% recovery for medium pile carpet and low pile carpets, respectively. For both methods, medium pile carpet retained more dust compared to low pile carpet. Incorporating collection efficiencies is important to avoid underestimation of microbial exposure, which has important implications for those with allergies and asthma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Farmers rely on irrigation systems to grow food. But the dams and canals that capture and convey this water from rivers to farms were often constructed over 100 years ago and do not utilize the best in available technology to make them more efficient. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> By addressing fundamental problems in aging water infrastructure, irrigation modernization provides unifying, multi-benefit solutions for rural farming, the communities they serve and the environment. Water saved from seepage below and evaporation above is then able to support both farms and wildlife conservation, while the gravity-pressured water eliminates the need for farmers to maintain costly pumps. In addition, the modernized system allows for the inclusion of hydroelectric power generation, providing both a resilient, local energy resource for the community and an earned revenue stream for the district. Modern irrigation systems support large, international farms, as well as local farms ensuring access to quality food for all parts of the community, especially vulnerable, underserved, impoverished populations. Lastly, modernizing irrigation districts offers an opportunity to co-locate broadband, fiber optic, or buried transmission lines, expanding access to the internet for rural communities and reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfires.

The reaction of formation of these molecular inclusion complexes is addressed in this research, as well as the main types of complexes that could be obtained. The Multiples Minima Hypersurface methodology, quantum chemistry calculations based on the Density Functional Theory and a topological study of the electron density were employed in order to characterize the interaction space of the two pollutants with the symmetrical conformers of the three CDs. Finally, for the β-HCH@CDs complexes a study of the charge distribution, charge transfer and dual descriptor was employed to elucidate the forces involved in the formation of these nanoaggregates. The formation of nanoaggregates was also experimentally addressed. Three types of fundamental interactions were observed: total occlusion, partial occlusion and external interaction (non-occlusion). The more stable complexes were obtained when the γ-CD is the host molecule, as it was confirmed experimentally by means of results of spectroscopic and electron microscopy analysis.

Hazard mitigation efforts at the local level provide an opportunity to incorporate information on future risks into existing mitigation program requirements. Communities and states that are interested in undertaking forward-looking planning efforts are challenged by several factors, including: (1) resources for assessing future climate risks are distributed across organizations; (2) projections of hazard risk depend on future emissions pathways as well as Earth system variability; and 3) as a result of 1 and 2, there is a lack of clear information, tools and methodologies that could be readily used by hazard mitigation planning practitioners.

This socio-ecological framework for examining the Earth’s surface integrates a number of key concepts in Environmental Science (ES). Yet, surprisingly little CZ science has filtered to the undergraduate level, particularly at primarily undergraduate institutions, where concepts from the earth sciences, if taught at all, are often framed with little direct conceptual overlap with other natural and social sciences. Since 2014, Roanoke College, an undergraduate liberal arts institution in Salem, VA, has partnered with the NSF-funded Calhoun Critical Zone Observatory to develop an undergraduate course in Critical Zone Science and Management and has restructured its Environmental Studies program to include a curricular track in “conservation and the critical zone”. This poster discusses insights from using critical zone science as an integrating theme in an undergraduate Environmental Studies program, with specific focus on the teaching of interactions between land management and water dynamics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is imperative that medical trainees understand the implications of climate change/planetary health on the physical and mental health and well-being of their patients. Recently, the COVID19 pandemic has presented additional threats to personal and planetary health, with numerous overlaps in risk and vulnerabilities. Students are provided with information regarding the pathophysiology and treatment of COVID 19, but not necessarily the connection between climate change and this pandemic. Climate change and the COVID19 pandemic have created a syndemic that must be addressed through shared solutions. We created a workshop for medical students to consider the shared drivers, vulnerabilities, and opportunities for solutions to climate change and COVID 19. Methods: We prepared a didactic presentation of health impacts of climate change and aligned these impacts with those of COVID19. Students were assigned to one of four threats: heat, air pollution, environmental degradation, and extreme weather. They considered scenarios in which patients can present with illness due to both climate change and COVID19. They then proposed therapies and strategies at the individual level as well as mitigation and adaptation for the community. Students were surveyed regarding their knowledge and ability to address this syndemic before and after the session. Results: Students surveyed before and after the workshop indicated significant increase in awareness of the connection between COVID-19 and climate change, shared vulnerabilities, and the need to prioritize actions that address both elements of the syndemic. Discussion: Our workshop gave students an increased recognition of the shared drivers and solutions for both climate change and COVID19 that impact their patients’ health and care. This exercise encourages students to consider their patients’ public health locally and globally and foster both climate responsiveness and pandemic preparedness.",,,,Japhia,Ramkumar,MD,jayasing@illinois.edu,Clinical associate professor of medicine,University of Illinois College of Medicine,Leslie,Herzog,"M.Ed.,MBA",leslie.herzog@yahoo.com,(Retired),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Boundary organizations mediate communication across these groups, using policy narratives as a strategy to build credibility and legitimacy. We present a framework for understanding boundary narratives.",Boundary organizations communicate through policy narratives,,,,"Governing agricultural nonpoint source water pollution is a complex task, challenged by the heterogeneity of agro-ecological systems, the politicized nature of agri-environmental regulations, and a reliance on the participation and collective action of individual farmers. These often contentious, multi-stakeholder policy settings serve as an ideal case in which boundary spanning actors are thought to promote cooperation across diverging interest groups, policy learning, and collaborative outcomes. This research integrates boundary spanning and discourse theories to investigate the use of policy narratives in a collaborative governance approach to manage agricultural nonpoint source water pollution in California. California’s Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program takes a unique collaborative governance approach by creating water quality coalitions that operate as boundary organizations, structurally situated between the centralized state water agency and farmers, and tasked with building cooperation among farmers and motivating the implementation of improved nutrient management strategies. We present participant observation and interview data with coalition representatives, farmers and state regulators to characterize the narrative strategies and approaches the coalitions employ under different settings to work toward the desired policy outcomes. Our findings suggest that this coalition-based decentralized policy structure amplifies contextual and ideological differences in actors across geographies, leading to varying levels of success in reaching policy goals and protecting water quality. We discuss trade-offs of collaborative policy structures that may allow for more locally-adaptable policy implementation, but also leave policy outcomes vulnerable to regional differences and varying approaches to managing and enforcing environmental regulations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed an extreme heat digital teaching game, polling users about preferred resilience strategies. This process helps acceptance of difficult political decisions on climate.",,,,,"Climate change and the urban heat island (UHI) effect are increasing extreme heat risk in the built environment in cities across the world. Extreme heat is the deadliest of all weather-related disasters in the U.S. (Hondula et al. 2015). Vulnerable communities are particularly at risk for extreme heat-related health impacts (Kovats & Hajat, 2008), making it a social justice issue as well. Extreme heat has also been linked to declines in economic productivity (Watts et al., 2018), can raise energy and water usage (Guhathakurta & Gober, 2007), causes additional stress to urban ecosystems (Merckx et al., 2018), and threatens the viability of cities (Pal & Eltahir, 2016).<br /> <br /> Despite this, the understanding of viable strategies to address extreme heat is still limited. An assessment of over 3,500 climate adaptation resources in the U.S. found that only 4 percent focused specifically on heat (Nordgren, Stults, & Meerow, 2016). Mahlkow & Top-down planning and design strategies for extreme heat are often not given priority over other community values, such as aesthetics (Hatuka & Saaroni, 2014).<br /> <br /> We have developed an interactive web-based visualization tool which teaches users about possible extreme heat interventions in a fun, game-like environment, and have used this tool in a version of a deliberative poll. A deliberative poll is a form of what public participation scholar Caroline Lee has termed “New Public Participation” (NPP; Lee et al. 2015). NPP practices incorporate rigorous public participation in novel ways and spaces, beyond traditional electoral politics.<br /> <br /> Our research demonstrates that this process helps educate the public about extreme heat and allows for better understanding of the tradeoffs associated with extreme heat resilience interventions. Furthermore, this process ensures that even difficult climate-related political decisions can be accepted within communities through an improved participatory process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The drought involves an increase in extreme temperatures and heatwaves, as well as its intensity and extension. Such changes have impacted the industrial activities co-located in the central region, intensifying the competition by water resources and catchment. The high temperatures have increased evapotranspiration, reducing water retention in soils, reservoirs, and distribution systems. Further, the precipitation rates have decayed, affecting the snow accumulated at the Andeans Mountains, essential for the water supply in the warmer season. Finally, the volume into rivers has declined, increasing the gaps between water supply and water demand. Given the increase in water requirements, water withdrawals have affected the recharge of aquifers, causing negative impacts on the water circle. At the policy level, discussions have begun to encourage the reuse of water, opening the debate at the level of regulatory implications.<br /> This talk aims to analyze the interrelation between technical concerns with entanglements at the regulatory level for one specific new source of water: the reuse of wastewater. Our interests are related to the technological options and effects on greywater treatment and reuse activity within the Chilean regulation (Grey Waters Law). For this purpose, we will focus on water treatment conditions as an alternative for resources of a different quality from that required for sanitary use, such as irrigation, industry, mining, among others.

A maximum water harvest occurs in winter months (5.0 m3/s); in others the flow is 1.5 m3/s. In June a 15% of the demand by the nearby communities could be satisfied.,,,,,"Freshwater provision is key for the sustainability of life in rural communities in remote areas in the Los Ríos region, in the northern section of the Chilean Patagonia. The area has experienced a 20% decrease in annual precipitation during the last century, and an expected additional 15 to 30% by 2100 (RCP 8.5 scenario). Thus, conservation of the watersheds providing freshwater is paramount. This is an on-going project aimed at estimating the seasonal variations of the waterflow in three micro watersheds in Raulintal, a private property of 2.058 currently oriented to the conservation of the natural forest dominated by Nothofagus alpina and Nothofagus dombeyi. The catchments provide freshwater for the 300-families rural communities located downstream, Mashue and Llancacura, devoted to subsistence farming. We performed statistical analysis on the precipitation and flow data (1997-2016) recorded at 8 nearby stations. Through streamflow transposition we estimated the mean monthly flow at the exit point of each basin, obtained seasonal curves and estimated its contribution to the potable water systems in the neighbouring communities.<br /> Preliminary results show a maximum water harvest during June and July with 5.0 m3/s; and a stable baseflow of 1.5 m3/s during the other months. The supply in June could satisfy a 15% of the demand by the nearby communities. In recent years the local counties have invested significant funds to provide water transported by trucks, in an area where water is abundant, but there is a lack of investment in infrastructure for storage and distribution. Conservation throughout microcatchments is relevant to guarantee the provision of fresh water throughout the year, but especially during the dry season. Likewise, in view of the climate change scenarios, it will be necessary to adopt an integrated management approach of water resources, which also considers adequate storage and distribution infrastructure, highly needed by the studied communities.",,,,Lucas,De la Fuente,Eng (e).,lucafuente@gmail.com,Associate Researcher,Universidad de Chile,Jorge,Soto,M.Sc.,jsoto@renare.uchile.cl,Associate Researcher,Universidad de Chile,José,Vistoso,Eng.,jvistoso@naturalcapital.cl,Consultant,Asociación de Municipalidades de la Cordillera de la Costa de la Región de Los Ríos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
